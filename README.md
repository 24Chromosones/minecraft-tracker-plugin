# Minecraft Tracker Plugin

A plugin that lets you roughly track players in Minecraft.

## Commands

**/track (player)** : start tracking a player

**/trackstop** : stop tracking a player 

## Features

This track plugin tries to balance tracking in Minecraft pvp SMPs to let a 
person track someone else but with limitations and risks. The command
gives a rough estimate through waypoints which slowly get closer to the player.
The player getting tracked can constantly see the tracker with coordinates and 
a lightning strike indicator.
